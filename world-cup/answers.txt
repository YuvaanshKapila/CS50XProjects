Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: I thought the as the number of simulations grew the times will grow as well but that wasnt the cast for the first three times.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:  after 1000 simulations, the trends seemed stable and the time-cost ratio was reasonable, so you would consider those predictions "good enough."
